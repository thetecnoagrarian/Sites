# Incident Report: Analytics Data Loss

**Date**: August 24, 2025  
**Time**: ~13:22 UTC  
**Severity**: HIGH - Data Loss  
**Status**: RESOLVED (with data loss)  

## Incident Summary

During a routine deployment to add analytics dashboard functionality, the live server's database was accidentally overwritten with the local development database, resulting in the loss of over 1000 page views and 3-4 days of analytics data.

## What Happened

### Timeline
1. **13:00** - Development completed on analytics dashboard
2. **13:15** - Git commit and push to GitHub
3. **13:20** - rsync deployment to live server
4. **13:22** - Live database overwritten with local database
5. **13:25** - Application restart
6. **13:30** - Discovery of data loss

### Root Cause
The rsync command used for deployment included database files despite exclusion attempts:

```bash
# COMMAND USED (INCORRECT)
rsync -avz --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='.git' --exclude='src/database' --exclude='src/public/uploads' src/ root@172.236.119.220:/home/deploy/fruitionforestgarden/src/

# ACTUAL RESULT
database/
database/blog.db  # ‚Üê Database was copied despite exclusion!
```

**The `--exclude='src/database'` exclusion did not work as expected.**

## Impact Assessment

### Data Lost
- **Page Views**: 1000+ entries (3-4 days of site activity)
- **Unique Visitors**: Significant visitor tracking data
- **Analytics History**: Complete loss of site usage patterns
- **Time Period**: August 20-24, 2025

### Business Impact
- **Analytics**: Lost valuable site usage insights
- **User Behavior**: No historical data for recent period
- **Performance Metrics**: Baseline data reset

### Technical Impact
- **Database Integrity**: Live database replaced with development version
- **Application**: Functioning but with reset analytics
- **Backup Status**: No recent backups available

## Contributing Factors

### 1. Insufficient Testing
- rsync exclusions not verified before production use
- No dry-run testing of deployment process

### 2. Missing Safeguards
- No database backup before deployment
- No verification of rsync exclusions
- No rollback plan in place

### 3. Process Gaps
- Deployment process not documented
- No mandatory backup requirements
- Insufficient deployment validation

## Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Incident Documentation
- Created this incident report
- Documented exact commands used
- Identified root cause

### 2. Process Improvement
- Updated DEPLOYMENT.md with critical warnings
- Added mandatory backup requirements
- Created safe deployment procedures

### 3. Recovery Planning
- Implemented analytics dashboard functionality
- Set up proper backup procedures
- Enhanced deployment safety measures

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Database Safety
- **NEVER trust rsync exclusions for critical data**
- **ALWAYS backup before any deployment**
- **Verify database integrity after changes**

### 2. Deployment Process
- **Test exclusions on non-critical files first**
- **Use dry-run mode for verification**
- **Implement mandatory backup steps**

### 3. Risk Management
- **Treat analytics data as critical business data**
- **Have rollback procedures ready**
- **Document all deployment steps**

## Prevention Measures

### 1. Mandatory Backups
```bash
# REQUIRED before any deployment
ssh deploy@172.236.119.220 "cd /home/deploy/fruitionforestgarden && \
cp src/database/blog.db backups/blog.db.$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
```

### 2. Safe Sync Commands
```bash
# CORRECT: Multiple exclusion layers
rsync -avz --exclude='node_modules' \
           --exclude='.git' \
           --exclude='src/database' \
           --exclude='*.db' \
           --exclude='*.sqlite' \
           src/ deploy@172.236.119.220:/home/deploy/fruitionforestgarden/src/
```

### 3. Verification Steps
```bash
# Verify exclusions worked
ssh deploy@172.236.119.220 "ls -la /home/deploy/fruitionforestgarden/src/database/"

# Check database integrity
ssh deploy@172.236.119.220 "sqlite3 src/database/blog.db 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM page_views;'"
```

## Recovery Status

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Analytics dashboard functionality restored
- ‚úÖ Deployment process documented
- ‚úÖ Safety measures implemented
- ‚úÖ Backup procedures established

### Ongoing
- üîÑ Daily automated backups
- üîÑ Deployment process validation
- üîÑ Team training on new procedures

## Recommendations

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Implement daily automated backups**
2. **Test all deployment procedures**
3. **Train team on new safety measures**

### Long Term (1-3 months)
1. **Implement deployment automation with safety checks**
2. **Set up monitoring for database integrity**
3. **Regular backup restoration testing**

## Conclusion

This incident resulted in significant data loss due to insufficient deployment safeguards. While the analytics functionality was successfully implemented, the cost was the loss of valuable site usage data.

**Key Takeaway**: It's better to be slow and safe than fast and sorry. Always backup before deployment, verify exclusions work, and test processes thoroughly.
