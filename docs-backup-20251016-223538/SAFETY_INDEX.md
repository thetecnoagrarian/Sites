- **One-command safe deployment**
- **Step-by-step safe deployment**
- **What NEVER to do** (dangerous commands)
- **Verification steps** after deployment

- **Server setup and configuration**
- **Monitoring and maintenance**

## üö´ What NOT to Do (Causes Data Loss)

```bash
# ‚ùå NEVER USE THESE COMMANDS - THEY CAN CAUSE COMPLETE DATA LOSS!

# Dangerous rsync (what caused the August 19 incident)
rsync -avz --exclude='node_modules' --exclude='.git' --exclude='src/database' --exclude='src/public/uploads' src/ root@server:/path/

# Dangerous file copying
scp -r src/ root@server:/path/
cp -r local-files/ server-files/
```

## ‚úÖ What TO Do (Safe Deployment)

```bash
# ‚úÖ ALWAYS USE THIS SAFE METHOD

# 1. Commit and push locally
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change"
git push origin dynamic-version

# 2. Deploy safely on server
ssh deploy@172.236.119.220 "cd /home/deploy/fruitionforestgarden && git pull origin dynamic-version && npm install --production && pm2 restart fruitionforestgarden"
```

## üö® Emergency Response

**If data loss occurs:**
1. **STOP all deployment activities immediately**
2. **Read [DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md](./DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md) recovery section**
3. **Follow emergency procedures**
4. **Document what was lost**

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Read [DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md](./DEPLOYMENT_SAFETY.md)
- [ ] Test changes locally
- [ ] Commit and push to GitHub
- [ ] Use git-based deployment (never rsync)
- [ ] Verify deployment success
- [ ] Test critical functionality
